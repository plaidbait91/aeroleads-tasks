The Google Brain team&apos;s success was the inspiration for many other companies to build up their own AI teams. <br> <br> Using Google&apos;s compute infrastructure, we started by proving that scaling up data and compute leads to huge performance improvements, and also created the famous &quot;Google Cat&quot; demonstration of AI learning to recognize objects (such as cats) by itself. Our technology for building large scale AI models was the pre-cursor to TensorFlow, and also allowed us to take deep learning to valuable Google products including ads, speech recognition, maps, and many others. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/technology/in-a-big-network-of-computers-evidence-of-machine-learning.html', 'start_date': 'Jan 2011', 'end_date': 'Dec 2012', 'company': 'Google', 'company_id': 'google', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/google', 'company_logo_url': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQGv3cqOuUMY7g/company-logo_100_100/B4EZmhegXHGcAU-/0/1759350753990/google_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=zYekdwB_mnXarr4wa4kw8w3Jikm8YaakM5aiDyAyvP0'}]","[{'title': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'degree': 'Doctor of Philosophy - PhD', 'field': 'Computer Science', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/uc-berkeley/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click', 'start_year': '2003', 'description': None, 'description_html': None, 'institute_logo_url': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQGwjF_5CYj_JQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1732135669731/uc_berkeley_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=7XwNqDpzm3ORttlebBpryt59e62a2tAk2Xf7mIuoOlY'}, {'title': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'degree': 'Master of Science - MS', 'field': 'Electrical Engineering and Computer Science', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/mit/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click', 'start_year': '1998', 'description': None, 'description_html': None, 'institute_logo_url': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQH-UXRfIDIKug/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1689799729035/mit_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=2BcyEkKb9m86JDvxtNLfDVfyept76unhOFNf5Wt_Vp4'}, {'title': 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'degree': 'Bachelor of Science - BS', 'field': 'Math/Computer Science, Statistics and Economics (triple major)', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/school/carnegie-mellon-university/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click', 'start_year': '1997', 'description': None, 'description_html': None, 'institute_logo_url': 'https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQH0rMqWuDcNzA/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1656670432790/carnegie_mellon_university_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aPUYNrOY_aNQ_xYOLYuS6QMkoaAk4TILUhTj-qpZOTs'}]",
